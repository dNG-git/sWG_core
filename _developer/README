1. Preparation and Requirements

Dear fellow developer,

Thank you for your interest in the secured WebGine (sWG) development
process. There are three Bazaar modules available:

- sWG_core:
The "sWG_core" package is intended for developers only. It provides required
core components of the sWG under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. They
are needed to develop your own software based on the robust sWG
architecture.

- sWG_basic:
"sWG_basic" provides all important and basic components like user and
session management as well as the cron and validation modules. This package
is (in connection with "sWG_core") intended for developers and is licensed
under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

- sWG_complete:
This module contains different modules, function files and classes needed
for specific purposes. Installing "sWG_core", "sWG_basic" and modules from
"sWG_complete" will provide a system usable for end users and developers.

Please note that prepackaged archives and the installation manager are
recommended possibilities for end users to use the sWG.

Before using the Stage Builders you will have to download a "sWG_core"
package from http://www.direct-netware.de/redirect.php?swg or do a checkout
from Bazaar.

Furthermore you have to add the "_developer" directory and copy this
"README" file to this location. Now the Stage Builders should accept your
build requests.

You need a web server running on an operating system of our choice and PHP.
We recommend the latest PHP 5.x release.

Corresponding to the planned usage you will additionally need one of the
following database management systems:
- MySQL 4.x or newer
- SQLite 2.x or newer

2. How to use the Stage Builders

WARNING! Do not install your development environment in a public accessible
location.

There are three Stage Builders:

- swg_build_stage1.php:
Used to create a new build of the "sWG_core" components.

Console command: php swg.php i_m=developer i_s=build_stage1
Web Browser address: http://localhost/swg.php?m=developer&s=build_stage1

- swg_build_stage2.php:
Used to create a new build of the "sWG_basic" components.

Console command: php swg.php i_m=developer i_s=build_stage2
Web Browser address: http://localhost/swg.php?m=developer&s=build_stage2

- swg_build_stage3.php:
Used to create a new build of a module from "sWG_complete".

Console command: php swg.php i_m=developer i_s=build_stage3 i_dsd=tmodule+XX
Web Browser address:
http://localhost/swg.php?m=developer&s=build_stage3&dsd=tmodule+XX

(XX needs to be replaced by the module name in swg_build_targets.php)

Format for data/settings/swg_build_targets.php:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>
<swg_build_file_v1>
<phpexit><![CDATA[<?php exit (); ?>]]></phpexit>
<stage1 swgversion="PUBLIC VERSION" swgiversion="INTERNAL VERSION">
<target development="0" path="TARGET PATH" phpversion="PHP ID" />
</stage1>
<stage2 source="PATH TO sWG_basic" swgversion="PUBLIC VERSION" swgiversion="INTERNAL VERSION">
<target development="0" path="TARGET PATH" phpversion="PHP ID" />
</stage2>
<stage3>
<kernel_group source="PATH TO sWG_complete/kernel_group" pdescriptor="kernel_group" pname="swg_kernel_group" swgversion="PUBLIC VERSION" swgiversion="INTERNAL VERSION">
<target development="0" path="TARGET PATH" phpversion="PHP ID" />
</kernel_group>
</stage3>
</swg_build_file_v1>

This file is needed to run Stage Builders.
