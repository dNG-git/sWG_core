§1 Grant

(1) Subject to the provision of §2, Beneficiary assigns to the direct
    Netware Group the Copyright in computer programs and other
    copyrightable material world-wide, or in countries where such an
    assignment is not possible, grants an exclusive licence, including,
    inter alia:

1. the right to reproduce in original or modified form;
2. the right to redistribute in original or modified form;
3. the right of making available in data networks, in particular via the
   Internet, as well as by providing downloads, in original or modified
   form;
4. the right to authorize third parties to make derivative works of the
   Software, or to work on and commit changes or perform this conduct
   themselves.

(2) Beneficiary's moral or personal rights remain unaffected by this
    Agreement.

(3) In some countries, the law may provide that the employer is deemed to
    be the owner of the rights on materials developed by an employee in the
    course of his or her employment, unless the parties have agreed
    otherwise. The Beneficiary is aware of these provisions, and therefore
    warrants, represents and guarantees that the Subject Matter is free of
    any of his or her employer's exclusive exploitation rights.

§2 Subject Matter

"Documentation." For the purpose of this Agreement, "Software" shall mean
all computer programs, copyrightable sections of computer programs or
modifications of computer programs that have been developed or programmed
by Beneficiary and that are specified in this Agreement below or that are
listed in Exhibit A attached to this Agreement and dated and signed by the
contracting parties. Likewise, "Documentation" shall refer to all manuals

Except in countries where such an assignment is not possible,5 the rights
(and licences) granted under this agreement by Beneficiary shall also
include future developments, future corrections of errors or faults and
other future modifications and derivative works of the software to which
Beneficiary obtains copyright ownership under this agreement. Excluded from
this provision are modifications that are not derived from the subject
matter and that have to be regarded as independent and original software.

§3 direct Netware Group's Rights and Re-Transfer of Non-Exclusive Licence

(1) The direct Netware Group shall exercise the granted rights and licences
    in its own name. Furthermore, the direct Netware Group shall be
    authorized to enjoin third parties from using the software and forbid
    any unlawful or copyright infringing use of the Software, and shall be
    entitled to enforce all its rights in its own name in and out of court.
    The direct Netware Group shall also be authorized to permit third
    parties to exercise the direct Netware Group's rights in and out of
    court.

(2) The direct Netware Group grants to Beneficiary a non-exclusive,
    worldwide, perpetual and unrestricted licence in the Software. This
    right's (and licence's) scope shall encompass and include all the
    rights (and licences) specified in §1. Furthermore, the direct Netware
    Group grants to Beneficiary additional non-exclusive, transferable
    license to use, reproduce, redistribute and make available the Software
    and / or Documentation as needed for releases of the Software and / or
    Documentation under other licences. This re-transfer shall not limit
    the scope of the direct Netware Group's exclusive licence in the
    Software and rights pursuant to §1.

(3) The direct Netware Group guarantees to use the rights and licences
    transferred in strict accordance with the regulations imposed by Free
    Software licences, including, but not limited to, the GNU General
    Public Licence (GPL) or the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL)
    respectively. In the event the direct Netware Group violates the
    principles of Free Software, all granted rights and licences shall
    automatically return to the Beneficiary and the licences granted
    hereunder shall be terminated and expire.

(4) The transfer of the rights and licences specified in §1 shall be
    unrestricted in territory and thus shall apply world-wide and be
    temporally unlimited.

§4 Miscellaneous

(1) Regarding the succession of rights in this contractual relationship,
    German law shall apply, unless this Agreement imposes deviating
    regulations. In case of the Beneficiary's death, the assignment of
    exclusive rights shall continue with the heirs. In case of more than
    one heir, all heirs have to exercise their rights through a common
    authorized person.

(2) Place of jurisdiction for all legal conflicts arising out of or in
    connection with this Agreement is Dresden, Germany.
